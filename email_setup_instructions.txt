EMAIL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR RESUME WRITING SERVICE
=======================================================

To receive contact form emails and send order notifications, you need to configure email settings:

OPTION 1: Gmail SMTP (Recommended for testing)
---------------------------------------------
1. Go to your Gmail account settings
2. Enable 2-factor authentication
3. Generate an "App Password" for this application
4. Add these environment variables to your Replit Secrets:

   MAIL_USERNAME=your-gmail@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password (16-character code from Gmail)
   MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your-gmail@gmail.com

OPTION 2: Professional Email Service
-----------------------------------
For production, consider using:
- SendGrid (up to 100 emails/day free)
- Mailgun (first 5,000 emails/month free)
- Amazon SES (very cheap)

OPTION 3: Custom Domain Email
---------------------------
If you have a custom domain, use your hosting provider's SMTP settings:

   MAIL_SERVER=mail.yourdomain.com
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USERNAME=info@yourdomain.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
   MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=info@yourdomain.com

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CONFIGURED:
----------------------------
✓ Customer fills contact form → You receive notification email
✓ Customer fills contact form → Customer gets auto-reply confirmation
✓ Customer places order → Customer gets order confirmation
✓ Customer pays → Customer gets payment confirmation
✓ You update order status → Customer gets status update

CURRENT STATUS:
--------------
- Contact form saves to database ✓
- Order system works ✓
- Stripe payments work ✓
- Email sending is configured but needs SMTP settings

To test: Add the email environment variables above to your Replit Secrets, then try the contact form.
